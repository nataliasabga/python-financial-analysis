# 🚦 Urban Mobility & Economic Productivity Analysis  
**Python | Pandas | Jupyter Notebook | EDA**

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed the relationship between urban mobility indicators (traffic congestion and travel time) and economic productivity (GDP per capita).

The objective was to evaluate whether higher congestion levels are associated with lower productivity — or whether economic growth correlates with increased traffic pressure.

This analysis was conducted entirely in **Python using Jupyter Notebook**, applying structured data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis techniques.

## 🎯 Business Question

What relationship exists between urban mobility (congestion and travel time) and GDP per capita across cities?

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🔎 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Standardized column names and formats  
- Converted data types for consistency  
- Handled missing values  
- Ensured consistent city–country labeling  

### 2️⃣ Data Integration
- Merged traffic and economic datasets using `pandas.merge()`  
- Aggregated data at the **city–year level**  
- Filtered for complete and reliable observations  

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Analysis
- Examined distributions of congestion and GDP  
- Identified outliers  
- Evaluated correlations  
- Visualized patterns across cities

## 📊 Key Insights

### 🔹 Economic Strength Does Not Eliminate Congestion  
Several high GDP cities still exhibit elevated traffic indexes.  

**Implication:** Economic growth alone does not ensure mobility efficiency.

---

### 🔹 Mid-Income Cities Show Infrastructure Gaps  
Some mid-GDP cities display disproportionately high travel times.  

**Implication:** Urban expansion may be outpacing infrastructure investment.

---

### 🔹 Outliers Influence Overall Patterns  
A small number of cities strongly affect correlation trends.  

**Implication:** City-level analysis is essential for policy decision-making.

## 💡 Business Interpretation

Urban congestion is not strictly a function of economic weakness. In many cases, economic growth increases transportation demand. Sustainable development requires:

- Infrastructure investment aligned with economic expansion  
- Data-driven mobility monitoring  
- Long-term urban planning strategies
